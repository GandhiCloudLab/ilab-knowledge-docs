## Target setting and tracking
Last Updated: 2024-10-17
Use the IBM® Envizi ESG Suite Target setting and tracking module to capture and track sustainability performance 
targets at any level of your organization. You can compare the performance of consumption, costs, emissions, and 
energy use that are associated with various types of activity data over time to a set of target values. 
You can set targets to match your goal setting and performance management practices and to meet voluntary or 
compliance reporting needs.

Here are some examples of targets that an organization might want to set:
Reduce annual CO2 emissions by 1000 kilotonnes (kt), compared to a baseline of the organization's CO2 emissions 
for the previous year
Reduce electricity consumption to a maximum of 10,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per month by the year 2028
Reduce water consumption to less than 10,000 gallons per day over a two-year period
Divert 75% or more of waste away from landfill to recycling or composting by 2026
In the performance dashboards, you can compare actual data to a target. For example, you might have a target 
to reduce monthly electricity consumption at a particular location. In a performance dashboard, you can 
review whether the location is on track to meet the target. You can view a chart that compares the 
actual monthly electricity consumption over the previous year with the target consumption.

### Target structure
You configure targets in two parts:
#### Target
The target is the folder or container that contains the target data. The target has a set of parameters that 
control the type of target data that can be captured, such as the period it covers and the type of target 
that is being tracked.
#### Target data
The target data is located in the target. The target data is recorded as monthly values against various data 
types or data groupings and against different levels of the organization hierarchy. One target can have 
thousands of points of target data.
### Managing target data
With a small number of targets, you can manage target data manually within the platform. For a larger set of
 targets, it can be more efficient to use a target data template to upload and update target data.

#### Target types
In IBM Envizi ESG Suite, you can configure several types of target, depending on your goal setting and 
performance management practices and to meet voluntary or compliance reporting needs.
#### Configuring target containers
Configure IBM Envizi ESG Suite targets. A target is a folder or container that contains target data. 
The target has a set of parameters that control the type of target data that can be captured, 
such as the period it covers and the type of target that is being tracked.
#### Configuring target data
You can create, edit, and delete target data for a target container that you select in a targets grid. 
You can either create and modify monthly data manually, or you can create and use a template to build 
upload target data.
#### Visualizing targets in dashboards
You can compare actual data against target or budget data in any of the standard location, group, 
or organization level performance dashboards. You can also compare actual data against your intensity targets 
in the Rate Analysis dashboard.
#### Viewing target reports
You can download monthly performance reports that show actual data against target data. To report on your 
intensity targets, you can access the intensity targets in the PowerReport monthly data set when you build 
a custom PowerReport.


## Supply Chain Intelligence
Supply Chain Intelligence is a module that can help you decarbonize your supply chain.

The module provides you with visibility into the emissions that are attributed to scope 3 - category 1 
purchased goods and services in your supply chain. Supply Chain Intelligence helps you to
- Identify which suppliers are most material to your organization.
- Engage suppliers at scale for the collection of emissions data.
- Automate the capture of transactional data from ERP and financial accounting systems.
- Gain insight into emissions hotspots in the supply chain to prioritize emissions reduction efforts.
- Develop a line of sight view into data gaps to improve the quality and quantity of scope 3 data.
- Gain a comprehensive and aggregated view of scope 3, category 1 emissions to support corporate and regulatory 
reporting requirements

## ESG Reporting Frameworks
In IBM® Envizi ESG Suite, the ESG Reporting Frameworks module provides a Sustainability Reporting Manager component
 that is used to create disclosures about a company’s environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies and 
 performance for stakeholders.

Disclosures are typically created to respond to ESG reporting frameworks. Companies use ESG reporting frameworks to 
publicly disclose business operations data that is related to the ESG performance of the business. Some frameworks
 are voluntary while others are mandated by a government. The categories and questions asked by each 
 framework often overlap. The Sustainability Reporting Manager component helps you to respond to multiple
  frameworks in a single workflow and to reuse responses across questions.

Sustainability Reporting Manager manages the workflow of disclosures and the approvals process and can be used
 to gather supporting evidence. A disclosure owner assigns the roles of assignee, contributor, reviewer, 
 and approver to questions to make sure that the appropriate people in your organization respond to, review,
  and approve questions. It also limits access to responses to those with the required access level. 
  Email notifications can be sent to notify of status changes, assignments, and due dates.

The component brings together quantitative data, attachments, weblinks, and question response methodologies
 to help you compose disclosure responses. The format of the response and the reporting frequency is typically
  prescribed in the question. For several questions, best practice guidance is provided to help 
  you respond to the question.

When you open the Sustainability Reporting Manager from the home page, it opens in a separate tab.

#### Logging in to Sustainability Reporting Manager
Log in to Sustainability Reporting Manager to create, review, approve, or contribute to disclosures.
#### Adding users
A system administrator can add users to Sustainability Reporting Manager.
#### Managed frameworks
Sustainability Reporting Manager is used to create disclosures to respond to sustainability frameworks.
#### Disclosures
A disclosure is a report that includes responses to questions from one or more sustainability frameworks.
 You can export the disclosure and include it in a sustainability report, such as your annual report,
  corporate social responsibility report, or a regulatory filing.


## Building Ratings and Benchmarks
You can use the Building Ratings and Benchmarks module to analyze and review your building ratings against 
benchmarks such as NABERS, Energy Star, and GRESB.

#### NABERS
NABERS (National Australian Built Environment Rating System) is a building benchmark system that rates 
environmental impact for Australia’s built environment, such as offices, shopping centers, hotels and more. 
Similar to the efficiency star ratings for household appliances, NABERS provides a rating from 
one to six stars to assess buildings' efficiency across energy, water, waster, and indoor environment. 
Use the IBM Envizi ESG Suite Building Ratings and Benchmarks module to track your NABERS office energy 
and office water ratings.
#### ENERGY STAR
You can partner with ENERGY STAR, an energy rating agency that is administered by the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, to obtain energy ratings for your buildings. 
You can integrate your data in IBM Envizi ESG Suite with ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager through 
its web service API, to get a real-time ENERGY STAR rating for your locations.
#### GRESB
IBM Envizi ESG Suite is GRESB's premium data partner. GRESB is an independent organization that 
provides validated environmental and sustainability goal (ESG) performance data and benchmarks. 
Envizi ESG Suite streamlines the GRESB reporting process for the GRESB Real Estate Assessment, 
Performance component, and it provides a dedicated API connection to GRESB’s web portal for 
instantaneous data submissions.
#### CRREM Scenario Modeler
The Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) EU-funded research project aims to support the 
building industry in achieving the required energy efficiency and emissions targets to 
decarbonize the building sector by 2050. Use the IBM Envizi ESG Suite CRREM modeling tool 
to compare the performance of your building emission and energy intensity targets with CRREM targets.


## Surveys and Assessments
Use the Surveys and Assessments module to capture quantitative and qualitative ESG data for your organization. 
The data is typically provided by property or building managers at each of your sites, who add the 
data to the platform by responding to surveys.

You can distribute surveys to internal enterprise users or to third party entities outside of your organization. 
The third parties might be suppliers or portfolio companies in the case of financial institutions.

The Envizi team works with you to define your requirements and to build the surveys. 
Various types of questions are supported in surveys, including text fields, picklists, and attachments. 
You can distribute the survey to respondents within your organization. Two types of survey are supported, 
which are a standard survey and a scoring survey. By applying a scoring mechanism, you can calculate 
average scores to compare respondents across survey questions.

Typically, surveys are used to capture qualitative data. You can use surveys to generate metrics that 
relate workplace strategies, such as
- Workplace diversity
- Codes of conduct
- Wellbeing initiatives

You can also use surveys to capture some quantitative measures about sustainability, such as emissions 
levels or renewable energy consumption.
The responses that you gather through the Surveys and Assessments module can help you to prepare 
responses to ESG Reporting Frameworks, such as Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) or 
Task Force on Climate-related financial disclosures (TCFD). The data can also help you with complete 
sustainability and risk assessments of your property portfolios. The data can feed into the disclosures 
that you make to sustainability frameworks through the Sustainability Reporting Manager module.

The Surveys and Assessments module uses the Issues Management component to send notifications to 
respondents and to manage the workflow of the survey. An issue is created for each survey that is
 distributed. An issue moves through these states:
- An issue is raised when the survey is distributed.
- An issue is set to investigating when a respondent answers at least one question.
- The respondent changes the status to submitted when they complete the survey.
- The survey administrator sets the issue to resolved when they are satisfied with the survey responses.

After you build the survey, you can create a copy of the survey, modify its name and effective dates, 
and distribute the survey every year. Then, in survey reports, you can select the survey from a 
previous year as a baseline year.

The survey administrator monitors survey responses from the Surveys grid and can run reports on the data. 
PowerReports can be created against the survey data set and are primarily used to run calculations on 
surveys that use a scoring mechanism. Extract reports are available to view responses and to export them offline.

If the respondent to a survey is a third party or the respondent does not have log in access to the platform, 
the respondent can respond to the survey from the Survey Portal. A link to the portal is provided in the issue. 
The respondent can communicate with the survey administrators by using comments.

#### Building a survey
The Envizi team builds surveys based on your requirements. You can request standard surveys or surveys 
with a scoring mechanism to perform comparisons.
#### Configuring third-party surveys
Assign users the survey portal user role and create notification contacts for the Survey Portal Surveys issue type.
#### Distributing the survey
When a survey is created, you can distribute the survey to participants and manage the responses to the survey.
#### Responding to a survey from the platform
Email notifications are sent to respondents to notify them about surveys that are awaiting their response. 
As a respondent to a survey, you open the link in the email that the issue has generated and you log in to 
the platform to respond to any survey that is assigned to you.
#### Responding to a survey from the portal
Third-party respondents and respondent that do not have login access to the platform use a Survey Portal 
to respond to a survey.
#### Monitoring survey responses
As a survey administrator, you can track survey responses to see what percentage of the mandatory 
questions are complete.
#### Administering surveys
A survey administrator can create copies of surveys, lock surveys, and delete survey responses.
#### Survey reports
Create reports to extract survey responses for your locations and to compare responses across 
respondents and locations.

## Sustainability Program Tracking

Organizations are challenged with identifying the least costly and most effective ways of meeting 
sustainability targets, such as carbon reduction, energy conservation, water reduction, and reduction 
of supply chain emissions. With the Sustainability Program Tracking module, you can compare the
potential cost savings and emissions savings of candidate projects and choose the projects that are 
best equipped to meet your targets. After you select the project to initiate, you can track and manage 
the project by using the module.

In Sustainability Program Tracking, actions or projects can be organized in a simple two-tier structure, 
where you define a program and add actions to programs. Alternatively, you can use a more complex structure 
three-tier structure with programs, action plans, and actions.

In Sustainability Program Tracking, each action is associated with a data type, for example, the lighting 
adjustment action is associated with Electricity [kWh]. The action might be introduced to reduce the 
cost of electricity, the amount of electricity consumed, or the emissions from electricity.

For each action or project, you determine how many savings you expect to gain from the project before 
you create the project in Sustainability Program Tracking. The key costs and savings that you estimate 
in advance for each action or project include:
- Annual cost savings
- Annual unit savings
- Implementation costs

Sustainability Program Tracking can automatically calculate the expected CO2e savings for the project 
by using emission factors based on the expected annual unit savings, the data type, and the location. 
Alternatively, if you do not enable the automatic calculation of emission savings, you can calculate 
your expected emissions savings and add the value when you create an action.
When you track your projects in Sustainability Program Tracking, you can customize how to represent 
your projects either by customizing the existing field names and values or by adding new fields.

Sustainability Program Tracking can serve as a data repository for your projects. As well as tracking 
candidate and active projects, you can keep a record of those sustainability projects that were not approved 
because of implementation costs or poor potential savings.

You can distribute the task of data capture for projects across your base of IBM® ESG Suite users. 
Each user can log in to Sustainability Program Tracking and capture the project data for their locations or sites. 
Each user can see the projects that are associated with their location only.

Several reports are available to help you project the expected emissions, energy, and cost savings that 
are associated with your projects. You can use a scenario modelling tool to see the potential impact of 
each project on financial performance and sustainability performance into the future. 
The reports help you model possible scenarios and determine which projects are worth your investment.

#### Capturing programs
Create and update programs, action plans, and actions to record, assess, prioritize, and track your 
sustainability projects.
#### Administering programs
Configure program settings, add custom fields, and customize existing fields to suit the needs of your organization.
#### Monitoring programs
View the details of programs, actions plans, and actions from grid views and PowerReports.
#### Modelling scenarios
The Scenario Modeler Tool is a PowerReport that models your sustainability initiatives by 
plotting the impact of planned sustainability, energy, or financial actions into the future.
