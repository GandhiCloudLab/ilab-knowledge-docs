  - question: 'Give me the summary about the ESG Reporting Frameworks module in Envizi.'
    answer: 'In IBM Envizi ESG Suite, the ESG Reporting Frameworks module provides a
       Sustainability Reporting Manager component that is used to create disclosures about a company’s
       environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies and performance for stakeholders.

       Disclosures are typically created to respond to ESG reporting frameworks. Companies use
       ESG reporting frameworks to publicly disclose business operations data that is related to the
       ESG performance of the business.
       Some frameworks are voluntary while others are mandated by a government.
       The categories and questions asked by each framework often overlap.
       The Sustainability Reporting Manager component helps you to respond to multiple frameworks in a
       single workflow and to reuse responses across questions.

       Sustainability Reporting Manager manages the workflow of disclosures and the approvals process and
       can be used to gather supporting evidence. A disclosure owner assigns the roles of assignee,
       contributor, reviewer, and approver to questions to make sure that the appropriate people
       in your organization respond to, review, and approve questions. It also limits access to
       responses to those with the required access level. Email notifications can be sent to notify of
       status changes, assignments, and due dates.

       The component brings together quantitative data, attachments, weblinks, and question response
       methodologies to help you compose disclosure responses. The format of the response and the
       reporting frequency is typically prescribed in the question. For several questions, best practice
       guidance is provided to help you respond to the question.'
  - question: 'What are the workplace strategies the Surveys and Assessments module can capture in Envizi?'

         - Workplace diversity
         - Codes of conduct
        - Wellbeing initiatives'
